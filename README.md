#Movies DB React based project
For now it is just tes project for the Leo Vegas company. But I have intention to made it real.

Project was written in TypeScript.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
You need to have .env file with API_KEY='your_api_key' param defined or set it in the environment

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
